# Project Introduction
This is an adventure company website I made with HTML, SASS and JavaScript.

# What Technologies Did I Use?
In this project I used HTML, SCSS for reusable "mixins" to keep my code brief, JavaScript, and Line Awesome for icons. I have also imported fonts from Google.

# Features
I have added many features such as parallax scrolling effect, Css positioning for a sales tag and media queries to ensure responsiveness. I also added icons from line awesome.


# What Could I Do To Improve?
To improve this project I could:
- Add form validation with RegEx
