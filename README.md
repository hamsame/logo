# Project Introduction
This is a landing page I made with inspiration from various web templates on the internet.


# What Technologies Did I Use?
In this project I used HTML, SCSS for reusable "mixins" to keep my code brief, and Line Awesome for icons. I have also imported fonts from Google.


# What Could I Do To Improve?
To improve this project I could:
- Add a ul modal at (tablet size and under) that links to other pages which closes when the background is selected.
- Add form validation with RegEx
